# Market_Sentry

Buyer-side real-estate market observation and watchlist system for Temecula/Murrieta residential properties.

## Project Mission

Market_Sentry is a disciplined market observation tool that helps buyers identify residential properties with significant market exposure patterns. The system begins with candidate discovery, stages candidates for user review, and monitors selected properties using Effective DOM, Quiet/Vibrancy scoring, garage spaces, gas-service evidence, listing churn, and cross-site validation.

## Current Milestone: Project Scaffold (MVP 1)

This milestone establishes the foundational project structure:

- ✅ Project folder structure
- ✅ SQLite database schema
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ CLI entry point
- ✅ Logging system
- ✅ Core data models
- ✅ Basic domain logic functions
- ✅ Unit tests

**No live scraping or network calls are implemented in this milestone.**

## Key Features (Planned)

1. **Effective DOM Calculation**: Measures property-level market exposure across listing, removal, and relisting events
2. **Quiet/Vibrancy Gatekeeper**: Filters properties based on location noise/activity proxy scores
3. **Gas Service Detection**: Identifies properties with natural gas service
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow**: User reviews candidates before promotion to watchlist
5. **Multi-Source Enrichment**: Cross-references Redfin, Zillow, Realtor.com, and other sources
6. **County Verification**: Validates ownership transfers via county records

## Critical Domain Rules

1. **Effective DOM** measures property-level market exposure across listing, removal, and relisting events within a defined lookback window, excluding periods reset by confirmed ownership transfer.

2. **Quiet Score is the gatekeeper**: Reject or heavily downgrade if Quiet Score is below threshold, even when Vibrancy is low.

3. **Target is very high Quiet AND very low Vibrancy**: Low Vibrancy alone is not sufficient.

4. **Gas detection rule**: Any mention of gas means the property has natural gas service/supply.

5. **Neutral language**: The system does not infer seller intent. It uses neutral terms such as listing churn, non-closing relist cycle, DOM reset pattern, and pre-portal exposure.

6. **Human-in-the-loop**: The workflow stages candidates for user review before promotion to the active watchlist.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip or your preferred Python package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rogerfiske/Market_Sentry.git
cd Market_Sentry
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

5. Create your local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferred settings
```

6. Initialize the database:

```bash
marketsentry init-database
```

## CLI Usage

### Initialize Database

```bash
marketsentry init-database
```

Creates the SQLite database and all required tables.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=marketsentry

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_gas_detection.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## Development

### Code Quality

This project follows Python best practices:

- **Python 3.11+** required
- **PEP8** compliant code style
- **Type hints** required for all functions
- **Docstrings** required for all functions
- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Lint code
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type check
mypy src/
```

## Next Planned Milestone

**MVP 2: Candidate Review Queue Import/Export**

- Create database tables and support manual seed data
- Export candidate review queue to CSV/Excel
- Import user review decisions
- Promote selected candidates to watched properties

## Notes

- This is a local-first application. All data is stored in a local SQLite database.
- No network calls or live scraping are implemented in the current milestone.
- The system is designed for disciplined market observation, not automatic purchasing decisions.
- All scoring and filtering logic is deterministic and unit-tested.
